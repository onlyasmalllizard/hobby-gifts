# HobbyGifts

A website where users can provide information on items that are useful for their hobbies and interests. Intended to reduce the urge to give generic gifts and discourage sales of useless items designed to commercialise holidays.

## Functionality

There are two types of user of this platform: list-makers and gift-givers. Account creation is only necessary for list-makers.

### List-makers

A user will create a login, which will require minimal data (email, password, display name). They will then be walked through creating a list of tools and materials used for one of their hobbies. Each item will have fields for them to provide enough detail that someone who is unfamiliar with the hobby should be able to purchase a suitable version of it. There will be a required field to explain why the item is useful and meaningful in order to promote understanding and fulfillment in gift-givers. Users will be able to add additional hobbies with their own lists if they please.

The user will receive an auto-generated link to a display page. They can share this however they please. Importantly, this website does not store details on how to deliver any gifts to the person. This must be provided separately, and helps prevent harrasment of users. There will be an option to regenerate the link to the display page if someone they don't want to have the link discovers it.

### Gift-givers

The user follows the link sent to them and sees the display page listing the hobbies of the user. Choosing a hobby expands the list of items related to that hobby.
